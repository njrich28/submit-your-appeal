# SSCS - Submit your  appeal

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/hmcts/submit-your-appeal.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)


## Background
Someone who receives a decision about their entitlement to benefits has the right to appeal against that decision,
if they disagree with it. The first step is asking the Department for Work and Pensions to look at the decision again. 
This is known as requesting ‘Mandatory Reconsideration’. If they still disagree, they can appeal to the Social Security 
and Child Support tribunal. 

Should an appellant wish to appeal online this web application will allow them to do so. The application takes the 
appellant on a journey, presenting a single question per page, at the end of the journey we present all questions and 
corresponding answers to them (i.e. their appeal), they may also go back to modify an answer, once complete 
they may downloaded a PDF for reference.

## Dependencies

To start the container run:

    $> make

Once complete you will be dropped into a shell:
 
    root@23a45b67c89:/usr/src/sya#
    
Now install application dependencies leveraging yarn:

    yarn install

Run the application for development:

    yarn start-dev
    
View the application
